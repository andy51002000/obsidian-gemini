# Gemini Scribe Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Gemini Scribe v4.0, an Obsidian plugin that integrates Gemini and OpenRouter models for text generation as an intelligent agent that can actively work with your vault. Gemini-only features (image generation, web tools, model discovery, and RAG indexing) remain available when the Gemini provider is selected.

> **New in v4.0**: Gemini Scribe is now **agent-first** - every conversation is powered by an AI agent with tool-calling capabilities. The agent can search files, create notes, research topics, and execute multi-step tasks autonomously while respecting your permissions.

## What's New in v4.0

### 🤖 Agent-First Experience

Every conversation is now an agent session with full tool-calling capabilities. No need to switch modes - the agent is always ready to help with vault operations, research, and multi-step tasks.

### 🔧 Built-in Tool Calling

The agent can:

- **Search and read** files in your vault
- **Create, modify, and organize** notes
- **Research topics** with web search and URL fetching (Gemini only)
- **Execute complex workflows** autonomously

2. Fetch and analyze relevant sources
3. Create a structured note with findings and citations
```

```
You: Find all my meeting notes from October and organize them by project

Agent: I'll organize your meeting notes. Let me:
1. Search for meeting notes from October
2. Analyze their content to identify projects
3. Create project folders and move notes accordingly
```

### Knowledge Synthesis

```
You: Read all notes tagged #machine-learning and create a study guide

Agent: I'll create a comprehensive study guide. Let me:
1. Find all notes with the #machine-learning tag
2. Read and analyze their content
3. Organize key concepts and create a structured guide
```

### Content Creation

```
You: Based on my daily notes this week, write a weekly reflection

Agent: I'll create your weekly reflection. Let me:
1. Search for your daily notes from this week
2. Read and analyze the entries

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with the Agent

- The agent is your primary interface - use it for everything
- Be specific about what you want the agent to do
- Let the agent break down complex tasks into steps
- Review and approve actions when needed

### 2. Initialize Vault Context

- Use "Initialize Vault Context" to help the agent understand your vault
- Update it periodically as your vault grows
- The agent uses this to better understand your organization

### 3. Use Context Files

- Add relevant notes as context for focused sessions
- Context files help the agent understand your specific needs
- Perfect for project-specific work or research

### 4. Set Appropriate Permissions

- Configure which operations require confirmation
- Use session-level permissions for trusted workflows
- Balance convenience with safety

### 5. Leverage Persistent Sessions

- Continue conversations across Obsidian restarts
- Build on previous work in the same session
- Use descriptive session titles for organization

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

**Agent Not Responding**

- Check API key validity in Settings
- Verify internet connection
- Ensure your model supports tool calling (all current models support this)

**Tools Failing**

- Check file permissions and paths
- Verify files exist and are accessible
- System folders (.obsidian, plugin folders) are protected from modifications

**Poor Quality Output**

- Add specific notes as context files
- Be more specific in your requests
- Try Gemini 2.5 Pro for more capable responses

**Performance Issues**

- Use Gemini Flash for faster responses
- Reduce context file count for quicker processing
- Break up large requests into smaller tasks

**Session Issues**

- Try creating a new session
- Check console (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) for errors
- Verify session files aren't corrupted

## Plugin Settings Overview

### Essential Settings

- **LLM Provider**: Choose Gemini or OpenRouter for text generation

2. **Be Specific**: Clear requests get better results
3. **Use Context Files**: Add relevant notes with @ mentions
4. **Review Sessions**: Check session files to see exactly what the agent did
5. **Set Hotkeys**: Configure keyboard shortcuts for frequent commands
6. **Trust but Verify**: Review agent actions, especially for destructive operations
7. **Session Management**: Use descriptive titles and organize sessions by project
